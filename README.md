# Meteo_Mysql
Try to store meterorogic data on mysql

just a attemps to store data for mlonger perios directly into mysql.
Initially it was a script to support bme680 data collection for "cacti"

first create a database called "meteo" and then import the "valeurs" rable structure.
I provided a user called "meteo" with full control over "meteo" only
